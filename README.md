This is a Python implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them into the empty space.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You'll also need the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip:
pip install pygame

# How to play
When you start the game, the tiles will be shuffled randomly.
You can click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to move it into the empty space.
Use the Shuffle button to reshuffle the tiles.
Use the Reset button to reset the game to its initial state.
Use the BFS button to solve the puzzle using Breadth-First Search algorithm.
Use the A* Search button to solve the puzzle using A* Search algorithm.
# Controls
Click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to move it.
Click on the buttons to perform specific actions.
